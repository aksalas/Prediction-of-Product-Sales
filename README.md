# Explanatory Values
## The maximum item price of the product is strongly correlated with the item sales

![Heatmap](https://github.com/aksalas/Prediction-of-Product-Sales/assets/95392861/aa49e07a-dca4-4e81-809b-a080f38f4420)
- Here we see that the Item's Retail Price has one of the strongest correlations with Item sales.
- Other data values have little to no correlation with item sales

- All of the items appear to have the sell about 2$,500,000 across all stores
- Here we see that seafood yields the most sales per product for each grocery store

# Model Evaluations

- Our model predicts that if the product sold in a grocery store , it will reduce its sale by $ 2000.
- The model also predicts that if the store is a type 3 supermarket, then the sales would increase by $ 1200 per count.
- Lastly, the model also predicts that the item visibility of items will reduce the sales by $ 266.

- The top 5 most important features are item mrp, grocery outlet type, item visibility, item weight, and supermarket outlet type.

- This model has item visibility as a lower influence on the model's ability to the previous model.
- for the most part, the features are relatively the same.

- The higher the MRP on the item, the higher the predicted item sales
- Grocery store types have lower predicted item sales compared to supermarket
- The lower establishment year, the lower the predicted item sales

# Looking at the product with the highest sales

![High Sale](https://github.com/aksalas/Prediction-of-Product-Sales/blob/main/high_sale_explanation.png)
- The most heavily influenced feature for this product is that it is sold in a grocery store.
- the second highest influencer is the products MRP

- The most heavily influenced feature for this product is that it is sold in a grocery store.

# Looking at the product with the lowest sales
![Low Sale](https://github.com/aksalas/Prediction-of-Product-Sales/blob/main/low_sale_lime_explanation.png)
-- The most heavily influenced feature for this product is that it is sold in a grocery store.

![Low Sale Force Plot](https://github.com/aksalas/Prediction-of-Product-Sales/assets/95392861/66cb5817-a3c6-4289-850f-00a82089c6c3)
- The most heavily influenced feature according to the force plot is that it is also sold in a grocery store.


# Predictor Model
## Regression Metrics for the predictor
![Regression Model Metrics](https://github.com/aksalas/Prediction-of-Product-Sales/assets/95392861/9f06858f-d83b-4dd7-9be3-893fbc1f3c5e)
- We used a Random forest model to predict item sales.
- The R-Squared for the testing data is 0.59 and an MAE of 732.
- These metrics mean that our model can predict how much an item would sell with a variance of .59 from the target price.
# Reccomendations
- Further optimization is needed to reach a more desirable model that can predict sales.
